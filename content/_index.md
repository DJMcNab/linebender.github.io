# Linebender projects

Below is a list of the main linebender projects, and a short description of each project's purpose.

## Crates (actively developed)

These crates are under active development.

 - [`xilem`][xilem] - An experimental Rust architecture for reactive UI.

   This crate is a spiritual successor to Druid, aiming to keep what is good while
   improving on Druid's shortcomings. It uses a reactive architecture built on
   top of view trees (this aproach is sometimes called 'virtual-DOM' or 'VDOM', which
   comes from its roots in single-page web apps).
 - [`vello`][vello] - An experimental GPU compute-centric 2D renderer.

   This crate contains a set of compute shaders and framework for rasterizing 2D
   geometry on the GPU. The goal is high performance, low resource usage and easy
   interoperability between platforms.
 - [`glazier`][glazier]
 - [`kurbo`][kurbo]
 - [`peniko`][norad]
 - [`velato`][velato]
 - [`norad`][norad] - A crate for reading, writing, and manipulating [Unified Font Object]
   files, a common font-design format.
