title = "Capitalization scheme for Linebender projects"
+++

All Linebender projects should follow this capitalization scheme:

- The project's name should start with an uppercase letter when referring to the project itself.
- The name should be all-lowercase where referring to the project as a Rust crate (for instance, in relation to crates.io) or as a Github repository.
- In the latter two cases, it's encouraged to use backticks to put the project name in a codeblock, eg Vello vs `vello`.

Feel free to correct any documentation you see to follow this scheme.
